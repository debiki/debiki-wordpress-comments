============================
Simplify
============================

- Add clearfix to .dw-res, so can remove ui-helper-clearfix from .php?
- Remove .dw-ar-t from everywhere?
- Replace:
   wp_list_comments(array(
					'walker' => new Debiki_Walker_Comment,
					'callback' => 'debiki_cfct_threaded_comment',
					'style' => 'ol'));
  with  debiki_list_comments  which calls wp_list_comments

- .dw-p and .dw-p-bd  (and .dw-p-diff ?) shouldn't specify background: white,
  that prevents themes from coloring .bypostathour comments.

============================
Misc
============================

- Test works ok with WP multisite
- Test works ok with Jetpack by WordPress.com
- Check if WP Super Cache's [x] Don’t cache pages for known users. (Recommended)
  is checked, if not, don't include their ratings in the generated html.
- Enable comment nesting to anly level? (Override default 5?)
  And don't mess up indentation?


============================
Security
============================

- Check nonce on form submission
- Proofread everything: check for XSS exploits


============================
Performance
============================

- Compute sort score while handling POST request,
  not when serving page
  Optionally, compute sort score after having replied to the HTTP reques,
  see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4806637/
          continue-processing-after-closing-connection
